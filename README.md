# PRODIGY_ML_01
Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms


# PRODIGY_ML_01 – House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project implements a **linear regression model** to predict house prices based on their **square footage**, **number of bedrooms**, and **number of bathrooms**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Develop a machine learning model that learns the relationship between:
- Square footage  
- Number of bedrooms  
- Number of bathrooms  

and uses this to **predict the price of a house**.

## 📂 Files in This Repository
- **PRODIGY_ML_01.ipynb** – Main notebook containing:
  - Data loading
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Model training
  - Evaluation metrics
- **README.md** – Project documentation

(Add your dataset if needed.)

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the `PRODIGY_ML_01.ipynb` notebook in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.  
2. Upload or load your dataset (must include square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, and price).  
3. Run all cells to:
   - Train the linear regression model  
   - Predict house prices  
   - View evaluation metrics

## 🧠 Model Details
- Algorithm: **Linear Regression**
- Steps:
  1. Select features: `square_footage`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`
  2. Split data using `train_test_split`
  3. Train `LinearRegression()` model
  4. Predict on test data
  5. Evaluate using:
     - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
     - MSE (Mean Squared Error)
     - R² Score

---

## 📈 Evaluation
Update this section after running your model:

- **MAE:**  
- **MSE:**  
- **R² Score:**  

---

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Add more features (location, age of house, etc.)
- Try Ridge or Lasso regression
- Build a web app using Streamlit
